Below are some general rules & guidelines to keep in mind when creating a PR: 

1. Do not include anything before the domain, like `http`, `https` or `www.`. Only provide subdomains if they are relevant.
> e.g. use `duckduckgo.com/rickroll` instead of `https://www.duckduckgo.com/rickroll`
2. Make sure to (also) provide the correct path to the rickroll. Just providing a top level domain (TLD) will mostly not be sufficient.
> e.g. use `youtube.com/thisisarickrollvideo` instead of `youtube.com`
